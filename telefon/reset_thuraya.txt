I think the following steps will help you.
Press Menu
Select Settings
Select Security
Select Factory reset (use 0000 as the security code)
OK.
Press Menu
Select Navigation
Select Current position to get the GPS location. The phone will show “Acquiring “on the screen.

After acquiring process which takes 2- 10 minutes, the GPS co-ordinates will appear. At this stage you can go back to the main screen and you should be able to see “Thuraya + the country code“ if all has worked well.

If not:

Press Menu
Select Network
Search mode
Select Manual
OK and wait for about 5-20 minutes until you get “Thuraya”.
Good luck bro!!
